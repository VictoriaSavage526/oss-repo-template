# Smart Questions, how to ask the question a Smart Way

My suggestions:

1. Be empathetic and remember the last time you needed help on a seemingly obvious task - we've all had moments where we've had to YouTube things we just didn't know what to do like "How to Use a Can Opener" or "How to Open My Car's Gas Tank," and people are at different stages in their programming journey.
2. Don't take questions personally - when reading questions, it is easy to read the question in our own voice, and people being confused at something we've worked so hard on can seem like a criticism of your baby. Often times, frustration about questions directed at your software creations really serves as a defense mechanism. 

# Free Culture

When I was reading this, I thought it was an interesting and tragic case of profit over common sense. However, I felt as though the author made some arguments that were a bit tenuous. One that really stuck out to me was the fact that only 1/4 of the files on the site were music files, and since that was not the majority of the site, the lawsuit is portrayed as frivolous. The mere fact that the content that caused problems was less than the majority of the site, that alone doesn't mean that it shouldn't be on the radar of the administrators. The same argument could be made for social media sites on which illicit and illegal media that causes harm to innocent victims to be shared. Social media sites do not promote illicit images, but someone raising a concern about harmful media being available on the site shouldn't be dismissed. The lawsuit right out of the gate was a bit of an overstep, I do believe. They could have arranged for a cease and desist for provisions for what they deemed as sufficient for Jesse to adequately caution and prevent sharing of music files. Jesse is unfortunately a pawn caught in a semantic battle of technicalities.
